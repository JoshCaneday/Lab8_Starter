## Short Paragraph

Graceful degradation means a site keeps working when advanced features fail, and service workers make this possible for network access. A service worker sits outside the main thread, captures requests, and serves cached responses when the connection is slow or offline. By providing this fallback the app stays functional and accessible even after losing its “best case” path to the internet.
